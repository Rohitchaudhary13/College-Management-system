<p align="left"> It is a C-Language mini project. This mini project contains two sub categories i.e Employee Management System and Student Management System. </p>

## Employee Management System

In EMS we can enter the details of faculties or employees on the basis of their working department and maintain a record of it. This project helps to maintain the attendenace of both students and faculty that works in college. First user can signup or create his/her own personal account in the system. Then he/she login and can enter any number of details about student or faculty. 
The processes it performs are: 
1) Add record
2) Show Record
3) Find Record
4) Update Record
5) Delete Record
6) Change Password
7) Logout

## Student Management System

In SMS, we can enter the details of student and calculate their total attendence. It contains one more feature by which it can easily calculate the CGPA of students by taking SGPA as input.

## How To Use?

* Step 1: Download these files in a seperate folder and open them in any IDE that support C/C++, preferably CodeBlocks.
* Step 2: Now Build and Run cover.cpp file, do not maximise the output window as it will ruin the placement of output text.
* Step 3: You can maximise when login/signup screen occurs.
* Step 4: Now Signup with your name, mobile number, city name and password.

## Problems due to which program may not run!

* Unavailablity of Mingw in the system can stop program from running.
* Files may be saved at different places.
* Running different file than Cover.cpp (Remeber you have to only run cover.cpp file)
